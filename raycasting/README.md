	2. Bling-Phong Illumination

How to switch between Ray Casting and Bling Phong illumination:
	- bling_phong is a flag which is used to switch between Ray Casting and Bling Phong illumination.
	
		- By default it is true; therefore it would execute bling phong illumination.
		- To switch to Ray Casting change the flag to false.
