# Texturing and Transparency

### by Harshit Patel(@hpatel24)

ASSIGNMENT TASKS:

•	Part 1: Render the input triangles, textured but without lighting

•	Part 2: Render the input triangles, textured but without lighting

•	Part 3: Render with texture and lighting

•	Part 4: Render with texture, lighting/lightmaps and transparency


NOTE: If you want to check the output without transparency, then you would have to manually change uAlpha to one in the fragment shader or else give input with uAlpha  = 1.0.
