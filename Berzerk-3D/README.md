Berzerk is a classic arcade game where a players goal is to kill enemy robots and stay alive. Bots can shoot player and player can also shoot bots. Apart from that, it the player hits any wall then they die. Bullets can be shot in eight direction that is vertical horizontal and diagonal.

This is a 3D version of berzerk with an over the shoulder view. It has been implemented using Three.js.
